        <h3>Feedback From Former Clients:</h3>
        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>I worked with Miyu to purchase my new home, prepare my existing home for sale and finally sell it. Throughout the entire process, Miyu’s guidance, support, knowledge and honesty was greatly valued and appreciated. Miyu guided me through each step of this very difficult and complicated process (especially in the very competitive Toronto real estate market). She achieved great results on both the buying and selling end of my transactions!</blockquote>

        </div>
        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>I moved to Toronto From Montreal and searched the internet for a real estate agent to help me buy a house. I spoke to more than 10 agents. One of the agents was Miyu. I had a good feeling about her from the very beginning. She is very humble and an easy going gal and more importantly very informed about different parts of GTA. I asked her so many questions and she answered all of them. The Toronto Real Estate market is so different from Montreal and Miyu made the transaction so simple and easy for me. I confidently, recommended her.</blockquote>

        </div>
        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>Miyu came over to my house and we talked for about 2 hours. She answered all my questions. She demonstrated that she cared about selling my house for top dollars by offering to paint my house and have it staged all at her own expense. She told me I could pay her back once the place is sold! I didn’t get any of this with my old agent! The next day, I hired Miyu and she sold my house for a record breaking price in a couple of days. I’m glad I called Miyu and I highly recommend her.</blockquote>

        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>People like Miyu are a rare gift in this world, she made a very difficult time easy for me. I was impressed with her recommendations and her offer to provide both refinancing and guarantee sale. Through her guidance I have found a trusted advisor who cares and goes over and beyond to help and provide assistance. I recommend her with confidence.</blockquote>

        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>I contacted Miyu from one of her ads and was able to speak to her immediately. I asked her a million questions and she answered every single one of them. She is well informed and very reliable.</blockquote>

        </div>
        <div class="text-bottom__testimony">
          <blockquote>I had a great experience with Miyu. She is extremely professional, personable and dependable. She took the time to understand my buying needs, I always felt supported and guided. She never pressured me to make an offer until I was comfortable and had found the right place. When it came time to place an offer, her skills as a negotiator shined and once the deal was done she was still there to offer support with closing. I would not think of working with any other realtor!</blockquote>
